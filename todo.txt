–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
• Pulse shape acquisition plot on tab-1 has live updates (audio version)
• Set more sensible default values for first launch
• Fixed minor bugs


ImpulseQt v3.1.7.0 – Changelog
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
• Centroid column in the calibration table now always displays bin/channel values. ✅
• Peak calibration table is now saved in settings and restored on startup. ✅
• Peak table now persists between sessions and is only cleared by the user via the “Clear Peaks” button. ✅
• Fixed a bug in single-point linear calibration. ✅
• Optional linearity trace added to the main spectrum plot. ✅
• Linearity points are now stored in settings and persist between sessions. ✅
• Added an option to download the peaks/ROI table as a CSV file. ✅
• CSV downloads now auto-append a unique numeric suffix (e.g. spectrum.csv, spectrum_1.csv, spectrum_2.csv). ✅
• Pulse shape plot y-axis changed from raw 16-bit values to percentage of sound card input (% full scale). ✅

Distortion metric redefined as a percentage mismatch between each pulse and the mean pulse shape, giving a stable, interpretable 0–100 scale for “shape tolerance.” ✅
